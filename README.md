Iâ€™m thrilled to showcase my recent Power BI project where I transformed static sales reports into dynamic, interactive dashboards for better decision-making at a business level.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose: The objective was to enhance internet sales reporting by moving from static spreadsheets to a visual dashboard. This dashboard provides a clear view of sales performance by:

-> Tracking sales per product and customer over time.
-> Comparing sales against budget targets for better financial alignment.
-> Allowing real-time filtering by individual sales representatives for personalized insights.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
-> A dashboard that updates automatically once a day, giving sales managers a comprehensive overview.
-> Ability to filter sales data by product and customer, helping sales teams focus on high-value opportunities.
-> KPI visualizations that track sales vs. budget, enabling managers to assess performance at a glance.

ðŸ’¼ Value to Business: By implementing this Power BI solution, sales managers and representatives now have an intuitive, data-driven tool to:
-> Identify top-performing products and clients.
-> Monitor sales trends over the past two years.
-> Make proactive decisions based on real-time data and performance metrics.
